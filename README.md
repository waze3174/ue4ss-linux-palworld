# UE4SS Linux — Palworld

A native Linux build of [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS) (Unreal
Engine 4/5 Scripting System) that runs Lua mods on a **Linux dedicated
Palworld server** — no Windows, no Proton, no Wine. Loaded with `LD_PRELOAD`.

## Differences from upstream

This fork's lineage is `BlackBookOfficial` → `kchu42754-cmyk` → this repo,
not three independent forks. The resilience features described above
(AOB-scan function resolution, the self-healing vtable sweep, and the hook
validation gate) were introduced upstream in `kchu42754-cmyk` and are
inherited here unchanged, not something this fork added.

What this fork changes on top of that inherited base:

- **A Debian 12 / glibc-2.36-targeted production build**, built inside a
  `gcc:14-bookworm` container via CI (`Build Debian 12 compatible UE4SS
  crashfix.yml`), for hosts whose system libstdc++ doesn't cover what a
  newer GCC's runtime needs.
- **A cross-runtime C++ exception-handling fix** for that build path: the
  statically-linked runtime (`-static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc`, required
  because GCC 14's bundled libstdc++ needs `GLIBCXX_3.4.33`, higher than
  the Debian 12 target's `3.4.30`) was leaking its exception-handling
  symbols into the shared library's dynamic symbol table, letting them
  interpose with the host's own `libgcc_s.so.1` and crash mid-unwind when a
  Lua mod callback errored. Fixed with
  `-Xlinker --exclude-libs=libstdc++.a,libgcc.a,libgcc_eh.a`; the build's
  verification step now fails loudly if any `_ZTI`/`_ZTS`/
  `__gxx_personality_v0`/`_Unwind_` symbols are still dynamically exported,
  rather than silently shipping a build that could still hit this.

Note: this repo also has a separate, tag-triggered release pipeline
(`linux-release.yml`) that builds inside a plain `debian:12` container using
its stock GCC 12 toolchain instead of `gcc:14-bookworm` — since that path
never statically links a newer runtime into the library, it was never
exposed to this specific crash in the first place. The two pipelines exist
for different reasons and aren't required to produce identical binaries.



Palworld (UE 5.1) dedicated server: **all major UE4SS hooks verified working
in-game** — BeginPlay, EndPlay, LoadMap, InitGameState, ProcessConsoleExec,
ULocalPlayerExec, EngineTick, ProcessLocalScriptFunction,
CallFunctionByNameWithArguments, UObjectProcessEvent, StaticConstructObject.
`RegisterHook` and Lua mods (e.g. AdminCommands) work as upstream.
Full hook table: [UE4SS-PALWORLD-LINUX-STATUS.md](UE4SS-PALWORLD-LINUX-STATUS.md).

Game updates are handled by three resilience layers — an update either just
works or fails loudly, never silently corrupts the server:

1. **AOB scans** resolve ProcessEvent, FName, GUObjectArray, GMalloc, etc.
   across recompiles.
2. **Self-healing vtable sweep** re-derives AActor BeginPlay/EndPlay slot
   offsets by consensus over all vtables in the binary at boot.
3. **Validation gate** disassembles every vtable hook target before detouring
   and refuses proven-crash signatures with a named log line.

After a server update, boot once and check `UE4SS.log` for `vtable sweep` and
`REFUSED`/`NOTE` lines before anyone joins — details in the status doc.

## For Server Owners

### Requirements
- Native Linux Palworld dedicated server (`PalServer-Linux-Shipping`), x86_64
- glibc-based distro (tested on Ubuntu; WSL works)

### Install
Get `libUE4SS.so` — from the [Releases page](../../releases) or a CI artifact
([Actions](../../actions) → latest `Linux & Cross-Compile CI` run), or build
it yourself (below). Then, next to `PalServer.sh`:

```
your-server/
├── PalServer.sh
├── libUE4SS.so              ← the engine hook library
├── UE4SS-settings.ini       ← hook & logging config
├── MemberVariableLayout.ini ← struct offsets (Palworld-specific)
└── Mods/
    ├── mods.txt             ← "ModName : 1" enables a mod
    └── YourMod/
        └── scripts/main.lua
```

Launch with the library preloaded:

```bash
LD_PRELOAD="$PWD/libUE4SS.so" ./PalServer.sh -port=8211 ...your flags...
```

If you use a server manager (AMP, Pterodactyl, a custom script), point its
startup at a wrapper that sets `LD_PRELOAD` and re-creates the symlink after
game updates (managers overwrite the binary).

Verify: `UE4SS.log` appears beside the binary and mods print their load
messages.

### Palworld updates
Just restart. The port re-resolves everything automatically. If a hook ever
fails validation after an update, the server still boots — the hook is
disabled and `UE4SS.log` names it (`Palworld hook validation REFUSED ...`).

---

## For Mod Developers

- **Lua mods**: identical to upstream UE4SS — `Mods/<ModName>/scripts/main.lua`,
  enabled via `Mods/mods.txt`. API docs: upstream
  [UE4SS docs](https://docs.ue4ss.com/). Nothing to port.
- **C++ mods**: must be built as Linux `.so` in `<Mod>/libs/` (not `dlls/`).
  Windows DLLs can never load here.
- Palworld-specifics that differ from upstream:
  - `RegisterKeyBind` needs a real TTY (no stdin console on dedicated servers).
  - GUI runs headless (EGL, hidden window) — no visible window on a server.
  - Console-command mods rely on the `ProcessConsoleExec` hook (works, fires
    on RCON/chat commands).
  - One mod crashing does not kill the server in most cases — per-mod crash
    recovery logs and continues. One known exception: a Lua callback that
    triggers a C++ exception inside the native hook dispatcher can crash the
    whole process rather than being caught, if the loaded `libUE4SS.so` has
    its own statically-linked C++ runtime whose exception-handling symbols
    aren't hidden from the dynamic symbol table (see the Debian 12 build
    note below for the fix used in this fork).

## For Contributors (working on ue4ss-linux)

### How the port works
- **Injection**: `LD_PRELOAD` → `UE4SS/src/main_linux.cpp` bootstraps inside
  the game process (no proxy DLL).
- **Function resolution** (`ScanOverrides`): `dlsym` against the process, then
  port-specific AOB/pattern scans for ProcessEvent, PLSF, CFBNWA, FName,
  StaticConstructObject; heuristics for GUObjectArray/GMalloc — all update-
  robust.
- **JMP thunks**: `RESOLVE_JMP` is thunk-aware (follows mid-function jmp
  stubs) — detouring a stub instead of the real function previously broke
  player joins.
- **Vtable handling** (`deps/first/Unreal/src/UnrealInitializer.cpp`):
  - Palworld's vtables diverge from upstream UE5.1 — per-entry verified
    overrides in the `is_palworld` block (NOT a uniform shift — do not
    blanket-shift, UEngine::Tick proves it).
  - The **vtable sweep** re-derives AActor BeginPlay/EndPlay offsets at boot
    by anchoring on the tick-prerequisite adapter thunk and voting across
    ~500 vtables.
  - The **validation gate** (`validate_hook_target`) prologue-checks every
    vtable hook before install: refuses junk targets and float/int register
    truncation (loud `REFUSED` log), notes shape drift (`NOTE` log) and
    installs anyway — extra pointer args pass through the trampoline safely.
- **Docs to read before changing anything**:
  [UE4SS-PALWORLD-LINUX-STATUS.md](UE4SS-PALWORLD-LINUX-STATUS.md) — hook table,
  verified offsets, crash-signature reading guide, landmines
  (e.g. `VTableLayout.ini` cannot override baked offsets; deploy the `.so`
  atomically). [docs/LINUX_PORT_AUDIT.md](docs/LINUX_PORT_AUDIT.md) —
  classification of all port changes.

### Build
Same recipe CI uses:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y cmake ninja-build pkg-config gcc g++ \
  libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev \
  libgl-dev libegl-dev libgles-dev
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

git clone <your-fork-url> && cd ue4ss-linux-palworld
cmake -B build_linux_Dev_gcc -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Game__Dev__Linux64 \
  -DUE4SS_GUI_ENABLED=ON -DUE4SS_INPUT_ENABLED=OFF
cmake --build build_linux_Dev_gcc --target UE4SS
# -> build_linux_Dev_gcc/Game__Dev__Linux64/lib/libUE4SS.so
```

Every push/PR to `linux-native` builds gcc Debug+Dev automatically
([Actions](../../actions)); pushing a `v*` tag publishes a GitHub Release
with the shippable `Dev` build as a ready-to-deploy tarball.

### After a Palworld update
1. Boot once, read `UE4SS.log`: `vtable sweep` lines confirm self-correction,
   `REFUSED` names a disabled hook, `NOTE` flags shape drift.
2. If a slot needs re-derivation, the binary method is in the status doc
   (anchor sweep + caller argument analysis).
3. PRs welcome — keep the per-entry-verification discipline: no blanket
   vtable shifts, verify against the shipping binary.
